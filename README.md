Compdb runner for VSCode
========================

This VSCode extension will automatically run [compdb](https://github.com/Sarcasm/compdb) when the compiler_database.json file produced by CMake changes, or when a different build directory is selected

This extension assumes you have installed [compdb](https://github.com/Sarcasm/compdb) already on you system. You can install compdb by running `pip install compdb`
